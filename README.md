# Wireless Sensor Network

The goal of the project was to collect temperature and humidity data from specific sensors in order to wirelessly transfer them to a computer (i.e without connecting the microprocessor to the machine), then to store this data to an IoT Cloud Platform in order to be able to follow the evolution of these data over time.
